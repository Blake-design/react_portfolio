# Blake McCarty Profile Website

Welcome to the repo for my portfoliio!

Here is a deployed link - www.co-theory.com

## About Me

So as you probably gathered from the title, my name is Blake McCarty. I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I have a background in journalism and advertising and I'm currently branching out into Web Development. I hope since you have made it this far you'll give my github a follow or reach out.

## What's Inside?

My Portfolio website is a React App that showcases some of my lastest works. It is a simple one page site that has links to various ways to contact me. It was build using react boostrap.

## What programming languages do you work with?

I'm a Javascript developer and have spent the last year exploring all the supplemental / auxillary languages that entails. I prefer to work in React using MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, and Node) and I have apps built using Express Handlebars and MySQL as well. Frontend development is my jam, as I prefer the immediate satifaction of seeing a visual representaion of code. Beacuse of that I spend my freetime playing around in p5.js and D3. Checkout my other repos and you might find what I'm currently learning.

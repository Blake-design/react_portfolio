# Blake McCarty Profile Website

Welcome to repo for my portfoliio!

## About Me

So as you probably gathered from the title my name is Blake McCarty. I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I have a background in journalism and advertising but want to change career paths so here I am. I hope since you have made it this far you'll give my github a follow or reach out.

## What's Inside?

My Portfolio website is a React App that showcases some of my lastest completed works. Just a simple one page site that has links to various ways to contact me and a carousel that holds links and descriptions to deployed apps.

## Why do programming languages do you work with?

I'm a Javascript developer and have spent the last year exploring all the supplemental / auxillary languages that intials. I prefer to work in React using MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, and Node) but I have apps built using Express Handlebars and MySQL as well. Frontend development is my jam, as I prefer the immediate satifaction of seeing a visual representaion of code. Beacuse of that I spend my freetime playing around in p5.js and D3. Checkout my other repos and you might find what I'm currently learning.
